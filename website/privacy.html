            <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Shorts Track Skipper never collects, transmits, or stores any of your personal data on external servers. Everything stays local in your browser. We don't use analytics, tracking, or telemetry of any kind.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Shorts Track Skipper is built on a <strong>local-first</strong> philosophy. This means that all data generated by the extension—including your blocked track list, skip statistics, and settings—remains entirely within your browser's storage. We never transmit this information to any external servers, third parties, or analytics services.
          </p>

          <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
          <p>
            To be absolutely clear, Shorts Track Skipper does <strong>not</strong> collect, process, or share:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal identification information (name, email, IP address, etc.)</li>
            <li>Browsing history or viewing habits</li>
            <li>YouTube account information or credentials</li>
            <li>Music listening preferences or patterns</li>
            <li>Any form of analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics</li>
            <li>Crash reports or error logs</li>
            <li>Device information or browser fingerprinting data</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Data Storage and Usage</h2>
          
          <h3>Local Browser Storage</h3>
          <p>
            Shorts Track Skipper stores the following information <strong>exclusively</strong> in your browser's local storage (using the browser's built-in storage APIs):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocked tracks list:</strong> Track names and artist information for songs you've chosen to block</li>
            <li><strong>Skip counters:</strong> How many times each blocked track has been automatically skipped</li>
            <li><strong>Extension settings:</strong> Your preferences for auto-skip, auto-dislike, and other features</li>
            <li><strong>Toggle states:</strong> Whether the extension is currently active or paused</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Browser Sync</h3>
          <p>
            If you have browser sync enabled (such as Chrome Sync, Edge Sync, or similar features), your blocked track list and settings may sync across your devices using your browser's sync infrastructure. This is a built-in browser feature, and we have no access to this synced data. You can disable browser sync at any time in your browser settings.
          </p>

          <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>
          <p>
            The extension requests the following permissions, and here's exactly why:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your blocked tracks list and settings locally in your browser</li>
            <li><strong>Host permission for youtube.com:</strong> To inject the "Block track" button into the YouTube Shorts interface and detect when blocked songs appear</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not request any permissions for tracking, analytics, or accessing data beyond what's necessary for core functionality.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            Shorts Track Skipper does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection platforms. However, the extension does interact with external services in the following limited ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>iTunes/Apple Music API:</strong> When you type in the search box to add a new track manually, the extension queries the iTunes Search API to provide autocomplete suggestions with track names, artist information, and artwork. These queries are sent directly from your browser to Apple's servers and are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. The extension does not store or transmit your search queries to any other service.</li>
            <li><strong>Search links:</strong> When you click a search link from your blocked tracks list, your browser opens YouTube or Spotify in a new tab (standard browser navigation). These services may have their own privacy policies and data collection practices.</li>
            <li><strong>YouTube data:</strong> The extension reads publicly visible song information from the YouTube Shorts player to detect when blocked tracks appear.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Aside from the iTunes API autocomplete feature, these are standard browser behaviors initiated by your explicit actions. The extension itself does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external servers.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <p>
            Since all data is stored locally in your browser:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data persists as long as the extension is installed and you haven't cleared it</li>
            <li>You can delete all extension data at any time using the <strong>"Reset All Data"</strong> button in the options page</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the extension automatically removes all stored data from your browser</li>
            <li>Clearing your browser's extension data will also remove all Shorts Track Skipper information</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Shorts Track Skipper does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The extension is designed to work entirely locally without any data collection mechanism.
          </p>

          <h2>Open Source Transparency</h2>
          <p>
            Shorts Track Skipper is <strong>fully open source</strong>. You can review the complete source code on <a href="https://github.com/Halfbyte-Media/shorts-track-skipper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> to verify our privacy claims. The code is auditable by anyone, ensuring complete transparency about what the extension does and doesn't do.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            If we ever make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page and, if appropriate, notify users through the extension's update notes. Given our commitment to zero data collection, we don't anticipate significant changes to this policy.
          </p>

            <li>There are no data processors or third parties involved who might have access to your information</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="privacy-highlight">
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Shorts Track Skipper respects your privacy by design. We built the extension to work entirely on your device, with no external servers, no tracking, and no data collection. Your YouTube viewing habits and blocked track preferences are yours alone.</p>
